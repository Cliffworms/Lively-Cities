# Lively Cities
 Adds static NPCs in Daggerfall's city streets.
 Currently covers Priests/Knights/Minstrels/Acrobats/Jugglers and some tavern goers. 
 
 More will be added overtime.

It is highly recommended to backup your WorldData folder before installing this WIP release for easier uninstallation.
